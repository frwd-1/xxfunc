# xxfunc

> **Warning:** This codebase is experimental and not production ready ðŸš§

`xxfunc` is serverless function support on reth using exex (execution hook).
We compile arbitrary code to `WASI` module and when exex hook is triggered, it will spawn a new wasm runtime and execute the code.

## Motivation

Not many people able to run/manage their own node. But yes many people want to run logic on top. That was motivation of `serverless function` invention. We wanted to give same ability for Ethereum full node.

## Architecture

- [`cargo-xxfunc`](./cargo-xxfunc/): cli tool to build, deploy, start serverless function.
- [`exex`](./exex/): reth + scheduler binary. Use execution hook to listen event and scheduler scraps all active tasks and spawn runtimes
- [`server`](./server/): public endpoint to submit function. interact with db.

## Define serverless function

check out [example](./example/)

```
#![no_main]

#[xxfunc::main]
fn main() {
    println!("ðŸ¦€ Hello, world from wasi!, exex notification data length: {}", data.len());
}

```

## Demo

terminal 1 (server)

```
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p server
```

terminal 2 (user)

Build arbitrary wasm module and deploy it to the server. And set state to started.

```
cargo xxfunc build
cargo xxfunc deploy --url http://0.0.0.0:3000 --wasm-path ./wasm_output/output.wasm
cargo xxfunc start --url http://0.0.0.0:3000 --module-name output.wasm
```

terminal 3 (reth + scheduler)

Run reth with wasm run time scheduler. For testing purpose, we added script to send mock exex notification per every 10 seconds.

```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY={ETHERSCAN_API_KEY} cargo run -p xxfunc-exex -- node --debug.etherscan --chain holesky --httpâ€¯
```

## Build and Run wasm module

- install `cargo-xxfunc` subcommand
- build wasm module with `cargo xxfunc build`
- run wasm module with runtime test

```console
./scripts/build_run_module.sh
```

## TODO:

- [ ] add status of functions in the module db. (eg started or stopped)
- [ ] xxfunclib include a handle to the reth datadir and can be called from the main function
- [ ] check WASIX / WasmEdge
